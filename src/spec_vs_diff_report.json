  "summary": "The diff implements the requested mobile-first UI shell (green header, bottom nav), the four screens (Home, Add Food, NGO Alert, History), three Add Food form variations with minimal validation, and a demo client-side data model that posts to History and drives the NGO Alert message/map placeholders. The diff also adds unrelated Internet Identity/auth actor plumbing and an empty backend canister actor, which were not requested by the BuildRequest.",
